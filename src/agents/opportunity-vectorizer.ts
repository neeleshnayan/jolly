export const VECTORIZE_PROMPT = `Read this job description and produce two things: hard FACTS (for filtering) and a role VECTOR scored 0.0–1.0 on each axis. Where the JD is vague, infer conservatively and SAY SO in the rationale — never invent specifics.

FACTS:
- title, company, location, remote (onsite/hybrid/remote/unknown)
- country: the country of the ROLE'S LOCATION — NOT the company's home country.
  A US company's Zürich office is in Switzerland; a UK firm's Bangalore team is in
  India. You already know which country every city/region belongs to — infer it
  directly from the LOCATION field (Zürich→Switzerland, Bangalore→India,
  Paris→France, "New York, NY"→United States, Dubai→United Arab Emirates). Full
  country name; "Remote" only if the JD truly gives no geographic location.
- comp_min / comp_max (only if the JD states a range; else null)
- comp_currency: ISO code ("USD","INR","GBP","EUR","SGD"…) for the comp range.
  Use the JD's explicit symbol/words if given; otherwise INFER from the location's
  market — you know a Bangalore salary is INR, London GBP, Berlin EUR, SF USD.
  Null ONLY when no comp range is stated at all.
- min_years_experience: the years REQUIRED (e.g. "8+ years" → 8); null if not
  stated. Use the overall/headline requirement, not per-skill sub-requirements.
- required_credentials: degrees/licenses the JD makes MANDATORY, normalized to
  exactly one of: "phd","md","jd","mba","masters","bachelors","associate"
  (degrees — md covers MBBS, jd covers LLB) or "cpa","ca","cfa","frm","cfp",
  "bar","rn","pe","pmp" (licenses — bar = admitted to practice law, rn =
  nursing licensure, pe = professional engineer). "PhD preferred", "a plus",
  or "or equivalent experience" do NOT count — required means the screen
  would reject without it. Requirements hide in prose ("you should have…",
  "candidates must hold…", "membership in good standing") — read for meaning,
  not just the word "required". Examples:
    "BA required, MS or PhD preferred"                    → ["bachelors"]
    "must have a J.D. and be a member of a state bar"     → ["jd","bar"]
    "CPA or CA designation required"                      → []  (an either/or — don't gate)
    "PhD in ML or equivalent industry experience"         → []
  Every listed credential must be INDIVIDUALLY mandatory (they combine as AND).
- company_stage (startup/growth/enterprise/unknown — infer from the company & language)
- domain (e.g. "fintech backend", "AI infra", "growth marketing")
- summary: 2-3 plain-English sentences on what the person would actually DO day
  to day in this role. Write it for someone skimming a job card who has NOT read
  the JD — concrete and specific (what they'd build/own/lead), not marketing
  fluff ("fast-paced", "rockstar", "make an impact"). No restating the title.
- core_requirements: 3-6 short, concrete bullets a candidate could check
  themselves against (e.g. "5+ years backend Go/Java", "has shipped a
  consumer product 0-to-1", "comfortable owning on-call for a service").
  Concrete and checkable — never vague adjectives like "strong communicator".
- must_have_skills / nice_to_have_skills: concrete skills, tools, languages,
  frameworks. Use each name's CANONICAL capitalization (TypeScript, Next.js,
  PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, React, dbt, gRPC) — this text can go straight onto a
  candidate's résumé, so "typescript" or "NEXTJS" reads wrong. Short noun phrases,
  not sentences.

VECTOR — what the role REQUIRES (0 = low/left, 1 = high/right):
- req_seniority (entry → executive level the role needs)
- req_leadership (IC role → heavy people-leadership) — judge by DIRECT REPORTS, not title prestige. A "founding engineer", "staff", or "principal" IC with no reports is LOW here (~0.1–0.3), even though it's senior. Only score high when the JD asks the person to manage/hire a team. Seniority ≠ leadership.
- req_technical_depth
- req_breadth (deep specialist → broad generalist)

VECTOR — what the role OFFERS (each score is the role's LEVEL on that axis, NOT whether it's good — 0 = the left end, 1 = the right end):
- off_building (0 = little hands-on building → 1 = building from scratch is the job)
- off_people_leadership (0 = no reports → 1 = leads/mentors a team) — same rule as req_leadership: a founding/staff IC with no direct reports is LOW even if the title sounds senior; score by actual team ownership, not prestige
- off_autonomy (0 = tightly scoped tickets → 1 = you run your own show)
- off_impact (0 = incremental → 1 = moves the needle)
- off_comp_level (0 = below market → 1 = clearly top of market)
- off_company_risk (0 = rock-solid established company → 1 = high-risk early startup that could fold; a seed-stage startup is ~0.9)
- off_growth (0 = steady-state → 1 = fast growth / stretch)
- off_domain_novelty (0 = standard next step for a typical candidate → 1 = a real domain pivot)

Each vector axis: a score and a one-line rationale citing the JD (or noting its silence).
