/**
 * The ONE tiered-vectorisation core, shared by the CLI (tools/tiered-revectorize.ts)
 * and the admin dashboard (runInference) so the two can never drift.
 *
 * Strategy: a cheap-fast model (granite) handles the bulk in ~5s; a row is
 * ESCALATED to the strong model (gemma3) when the fast extraction is thin
 * (skills scrubbed to <2), has no real summary, OR the fast model itself flagged
 * the JD as hard (needs_review). The escalation is deliberately OR'd so an
 * overconfident self-report can't hide an objectively thin extraction, and a
 * grounded self-flag catches wrong-but-present output the heuristics miss.
 *
 * Pure functions of the DB + the LLM provider — callers own batching, cooldowns,
 * progress, and the model-resident order (all-fast then all-strong = one swap).
